#Collab Painter

This was my bachelor degree project, I only implemented the code related to the filters applied to images, the painting brush and the very early steps of the back-end in Node.js. While working at the project I had an amazing time working with two other PhD students from the Department of Computer Science of La Sapienza Rome.
